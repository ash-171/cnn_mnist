# CNN Fashion MNIST Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to build and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is a dataset consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of 10 different fashion item categories, each represented as a 28x28 grayscale image.

## Project Structure
- **Notebook Filename:** CNN_FashionMNIST.ipynb
- **Data:** The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded directly from the TensorFlow library.
- **Model Architecture:** The CNN model architecture is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API, consisting of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, flatten layers, and dense layers.
- **Training:** The model is trained on the training dataset using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
- **Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.
- **Results:** The model's accuracy, loss, and classification reports are presented for evaluation.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `CNN_FashionMNIST.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to load the data, build and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
4. View the results and analysis provided in the notebook.

## Usage
- The notebook serves as a guide for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model for fashion item classification.
- Modify the model architecture, hyperparameters, or training configurations as needed for experimentation.
